- sudo usermod -a -G vboxsf vagrant
- Change Name to: DuckDuckHack 2014-08-27 VBox (assuming that's today's date)
- Disable VT-x/AMD-V (This will noticeably decrease performance, but many
                      computers do not support this or have it disabled in
                      the BIOS.)
- Enable PAE/NX (Ubuntu 12.04 virtual kernels require this.)
- Remove Port Forwarding for port 22
- Remove shared folders (before exporting as an OVF/OVA)
- Once you are finished, export to an OVA with the following settings:
  1. Filename: ddh-vbox-2014-08-27 (assuming that's today's date)
  2. Format: OVF 1.0
  3. Write Manifest file: Yes
  Note: With these settings, the VM can be imported as far back as 4.1.x
        at least.
