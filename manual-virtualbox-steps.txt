- sudo usermod -a -G vboxsf vagrant
- Shutdown the VM. But before you do, run this command to make the X11 desktop
  be reasonably small, 800x600:
  xrandr --output VBOX0 --mode 800x600
  This is needed because when the VM reboots, the lightdm login screen will be
  at the previously used resolution. A large resolution may be too big for many
  users' monitors.
- Change Name to: DuckDuckHack
  (Note, the name you specify during export will be ignored in favor of this
   name)
- Disable VT-x/AMD-V (This will noticeably decrease performance, but many
                      computers do not support this or have it disabled in
                      the BIOS.)
- Enable PAE/NX (Ubuntu 12.04 virtual kernels require this.)
- Remove Port Forwarding for port 22
- Remove shared folders (before exporting as an OVF/OVA)
- Once you are finished, export to an OVA with the following settings:
  1. Filename: ddh-vbox-2014-08-27 (assuming that's today's date)
  2. Format: OVF 1.0
  3. Write Manifest file: Yes
  Note: With these settings, the VM can be imported as far back as 4.1.x
        at least.
