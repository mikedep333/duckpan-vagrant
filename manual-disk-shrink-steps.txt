Then, create a new 8GB .vmdk dynamically expanding hard disk
And boot the from an ubuntu 12.04.x amd64 live cd.

# These steps apply to the current boxes, where there is no LVM setup.

Open Gnome Disk Utility
For the new hard disk, select "Format Drive" and select MBR.
Create a "7.516 GB" ext4 partition (actually 7GB). Name: cloudimg-rootfs. Deselect "Take ownership of filesystem".
Crete a swap partition with the remaining space. Name: swap
# Note: No need to copy the filesystem's UUID because the box's fstab uses the
# LABEL to know which fs to mount.
mount the 2 partitions /mnt/sda1 and /mnt/sdb1
sudo rsync -aAXv /mnt/sda1/* /mnt/sdb1/ --exclude={/dev/*,/proc/*,/sys/*,/tmp/*,/run/*,/mnt/*,/media/*,/lost+found}
Make sure the root of /dev/sdb1 is owned by root:root and mode 755
edit /dev/sdb1/etc/fstab to add the line:
LABEL=swap		none	swap	sw	0 0

shutdown and detach the original hard disk

Boot the the CD again and:
reinstall grub according to the instructions here:
http://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-repair-restore-reinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd
Then shutdown and reboot from the new hard disk.

Test booting from the new hard disk.

Once tested, delete the old hard disk.
Switch the SATA port that the hard disk is in to "SATA Port 0"
Switch the SATA controller to having only 2 ports.
