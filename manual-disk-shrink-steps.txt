comment out every ^deb-src line in /etc/apt/sources.list

sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get autoclean

# Remove the directory
sudo rm -fr /var/lib/apt/lists

# Recreate the necessary directory structure
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/apt/lists/partial

sudo rm -f /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin
sudo rm -f /var/cache/apt/srcpkgcache.bin

sudo apt-get purge apt-xapian-index
sudo rm -r /var/cache/apt-xapian-index

rm -rf ~/.cpanm/work/*

then, create a new 8GB hard disk, and boot the from an ubuntu 12.04.x amd64 live cd:

install package lvm2

"copy" /dev/sda1 as /dev/sdb1 using gparted

Recreate the lvm structure and volumes. the "root" volume is ext4. 

rsync -aAXv /* /path/to/backup/folder --exclude={/dev/*,/proc/*,/sys/*,/tmp/*,/run/*,/mnt/*,/media/*,/lost+found}

make sure that / has permissions 755 and is owned by root:root

edit /etc/fstab to point to the new LV paths.
No need to edit /etc/fstab for the new boot volume's UUID so long as you "copied" it using gparted

reinstall grub according to the instructions here:
http://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-repair-restore-reinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd
(you can ignore the part about /dev/pts)

once done, you can detach the old hard disk. Once you test using the new hard disk, you can delete the old one.
