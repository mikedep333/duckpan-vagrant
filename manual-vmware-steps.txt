# Done using VMware Workstation Tech Preview 2014
# The VM can be imported as far back as VMware Player 4.0.x
# (which corresponds to VMware Workstation 8.0.x)

Import the VirtualBox .ova.
Name: ddh-vmw-2014-12-31 (assuming that is today's date)
You will need to select to relax the hardware check.
(Presumably because VMware does not support AHCI.)

Change the OS from "Ubuntu 64-bit" to "Ubuntu"

Change the virtual hardware compatiblity to 8.0 (Under "manage")

Enable shared folders.
Sync guest time with host.

Detach hard disk from IDE interface and reattach using SCSI.
When prompted, do not select to upgrade the VMDK format.

Change the DVD drive from being on IDE 0:1 to IDE 0:0  so that you do not get an error when starting the VM.
Deselect "Connect at power on" for the DVD drive.

Once you login to a TTY:
sudo apt-get update
# Prevent xorg and xserver-xorg from being removed during the next step
sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-vmware
sudo apt-get purge virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11
# Open Source VMware Tools. Depends on the drivers package.
sudo apt-get install open-vm-toolbox
# We need to switch to the generic kernel to get the vmwgfx kernel module
sudo apt-get install linux-generic linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic
# This step assumes the current kernel version is 3.2.0-67
sudo apt-get purge linux-virtual linux-image-virtual linxu-image-3.2.0.67-virtual linux-headers-virtual linux-headers-3.2.0.67-virtual
sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-generic
sudo dpkg-reconfigure open-vm-dkms
sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg-video-vmware
sudo reboot

You should now be booted to X11.

Then repeat manual-disk-shrink-steps.txt

Description: (See manual-virtualbox-steps.txt)

# Note, we would set the Appliance View "Version" and "Author"
# but VMware Workstation and VMware Player ignore them when exporting.
# Even if you manually edit the .OVF, they also ingore them when importing.

#Run this command, adjusting the file paths as needed:

#
# Note the use of a .ovf file extension, not .ova
File -> Export to OVF -> ddh-vmw-2014-10-14.ovf

Copy LICENSE.txt to a copy (LICENSE.txt.vmware) with new line at the top with nothing but a '.' character.
This works around a text rendering bug in VMware.

# This command uses max compression, which VMware workstation's GUI does not offer.
# It also sets the license file.
