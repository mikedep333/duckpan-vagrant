# Done using VMware Workstation Tech Preview 2014
# The VM can be imported as far back as VMware Player 4.0.x
# (which corresponds to VMware Workstation 8.0.x)

Import the VirtualBox .ova.
Name: ddh-vmw-2014-12-31 (assuming that is today's date)
You will need to select to relax the hardware check.
(Presumably because VMware does not support AHCI.)

Change the OS from "Ubuntu 64-bit" to "Ubuntu"

Change the virtual hardware compatiblity to 8.0 (Under "manage")

Enable shared folders.
Sync guest time with host.

Detach hard disk from IDE interface and reattach using SCSI.
When prompted, do not select to upgrade the VMDK format.

Change the DVD from being on IDE 0:1 to IDE 0:0 the DVD so that you do not get an error when starting the VM.

Once you login to a TTY:
sudo apt-get purge virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11
sudo apt-get update
# Open Source VMware Tools. Depends on the drivers package.
sudo apt-get install open-vm-toolbox
# We need to switch to the generic kernel to get the vmwgfx kernel module
sudo apt-get install linux-generic linux-image-generic linux-headers-generic
# This step assumes the current kernel version is 3.2.0-67
sudo apt-get purge linux-virtual linux-image-virtual linxu-image-3.2.0.67-virtual linux-headers-virtual linux-headers-3.2.0.67-virtual
sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg
sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-generic
sudo dpkg-reconfigure open-vm-dkms
sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg-video-vmware
sudo reboot

You should now be booted to X11.

Then repeat manual-disk-shrink-steps.txt

Description: (See manual-virtualbox-steps.txt)
Settings -> Options -> Appliance View -> Version (See manual-virtualbox-steps.txt)
Settings -> Options -> Appliance View -> Author (See "Vendor" from manual-virtualbox-steps.txt)

Then export as a .ova with a name in the format: ddh-vmw-2014-10-05.ova
 Make sure you give the file a name that ends with .ova, not .ovf.
