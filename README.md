[DuckPAN](https://github.com/duckduckgo/p5-app-duckpan) is an application built to provide developers a testing environment for [DuckDuckHack Instant Answers](http://duckduckhack.com). It allows you to test instant answer triggers and preview their visual design and output.

This project provides a Vagrant-based development setup for DuckPAN.

This branch is intended to provide the complete DuckDuckHack VM.

### Installation

1. Install: [Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/#getting-started)

2. Clone this repo

3. Run `bundle install` to install Berkshelf.  

4. Install the dependencies for vagrant-berkshelf. On Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf`

5. Run `vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf --plugin-version=2.0.1`

6. Run `vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus` so that Chef within the box can be upgraded to a version compatible with chef on the host OS.

7. Review the CUSTOM_CONFIG settings at the top of Vagrant file.  You will want to customize the value of the synced directory to point to your local directory containing the DuckDuckGo code you wish to test.  By default, Vagrant will load a [VirtualBox Precise64](http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/precise/current/precise-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1.box) machine image.  If you change this, DuckDuckGo recommends Ubuntu (https://github.com/duckduckgo/p5-app-duckpan#disclaimer).

8. If you wish to create a command-line-only duckduckhack-vm, comment out the line in VagrantFile. You can run this command to do so: `sed "s/ chef.add_recipe 'duckduckhack-vm::duckduckhack-gui'/ # chef.add_recipe 'duckduckhack-vm::duckduckhack-gui'/g" Vagrantfile`

9. Run `vagrant up duckduckhack`

The box takes some time to stand up.  As the duckpan-install script runs, you won't see any output for about 20 minutes. Refer to [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) for more info.

### Usage

You can find the usage instructions for DuckPAN here: https://github.com/duckduckgo/p5-app-duckpan#using-duckpan

By default, after starting `duckpan server` you can access the web interface at http://0.0.0.0:5000

### Troubleshooting

#### Slow Chef Run

The Chef run may take a while to complete, and during this process, you may see no output from vagrant.

You can ssh into the box and run top to verify installation is still occurring. Look for either the chef-solo or perl processes.

```sh
vagrant ssh
top
```
